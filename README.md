# the human model project

## Why

To understand your self you must understand:

1. the `body` (diet, exercise, anatomy, medicine, ...)
2. the `mind` (physchology, neurology, creativity, ...)

Becuase you have a self, you have a right to:

1. all information about the self
2. posessed by any credible source that wants to share it (1)
3. forever, free and anonymously

## Goals

- Create the most acurate model of the human self ever created
- Optimize information for quality then quantity
- Optimize user experience for ease of use then audience size
